kishor9096: i dont need the dependency on db as I am connecting external DB via .env so please update and ensure the .env is added to docker configuration while starting

GitHub Copilot: To remove the dependency on the `db` service and ensure the .env file is used for environment variables, you can update your docker-compose.yml file as follows:

1. Remove the `depends_on` section from the `web` service.
2. Add the `env_file` directive to the `web` service to load environment variables from the .env file.

Here is the updated docker-compose.yml:

```dockercompose
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "${APP_PORT}:${APP_PORT}"
    environment:
      - FLASK_APP=app.py
      - FLASK_ENV=production
      - APP_PORT=${APP_PORT}
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    env_file:
      - .env

volumes:
  db_data:
```

Make sure you have a .env file in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml with the necessary environment variables defined, such as `APP_PORT`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

kishor9096: how to deploy to docker

GitHub Copilot: To deploy your application to Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure your .env file is properly configured** with the necessary environment variables, such as `APP_PORT`.

2. **Build the Docker image** using the `docker-compose` command:
   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container** using the `docker-compose` command:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

Here is a summary of the steps:

1. **Create a .env file** in the root directory of your project (if not already created):
   ```env
   APP_PORT=5000
   MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database
   MYSQL_USER=your_user
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This will build and start your Docker container, running your application on the specified port. You can check the logs to ensure everything is running correctly:
```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

To stop the Docker container, use:
```sh
docker-compose down
```
